# reactJs_Google_People_Api
Implementing google People API to fetch user's contacts from Google account.
To make it work put your own Api key and ClientID, go to the People.js file in components folder.
At the top assign values to API_KEY and CLIENT_ID.

Its still ongoing development, I will keep adding different features, bug fixes as I get time.

Known bugs:
---
1. Issue with async load of googleAPi.js, gapi object not found.
2. Dividing code into further modules to make it easier to maintain.
3. On load, component first renders in Un-Auth mode, then reset to auth mode.

Let me know, if any questions.
